A stylized logo featuring a farmer wearing a straw hat, holding a glowing digital coin in one hand, standing in a green field with a subtle blockchain pattern overlay. The background is a soft gradient of sky blue and fresh green, giving a sense of growth and technology blending together. The farmer's silhouette is friendly and approachable, with a slight smile, and the digital coin glows with a faint halo to emphasize its importance in the crypto world.
